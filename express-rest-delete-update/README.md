# Express RESTful Routes: Update & Delete

## POSTMAN

Even though the command line is powerful and you can do amazing things like this: `curl -s -L http://bit.ly/10hA8iC | bash` ( <kbd>control</kbd> <kbd>c</kbd> to cancel it), it can end up being a LOT of typing, especially when one wants to thoroughly test a back-end.

So, some developers got together and built a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to allow developers to test their back-ends.

Once you open the app, it will ask you to log in. However, if you look very carefully, you can find a `skip` option in tiny letters.

Postman is a very robust tool with a lot of functionality. We'll just be using it in a very simple way for now, and we'll learn a bit more useful things as we keep building out our app.
