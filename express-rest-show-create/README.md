# Express RESTful Routes, Middleware: Show and Create

#

## Intro

So far, we've learned a little about the MVC pattern for organizing and maintaining our code. We'll keep building our app with a loose adaptation of this pattern.

You may encounter other code libraries or frameworks like Ruby on Rails. Ruby on Rails follows a principle of convention over configuration - meaning if you follow the rules of RoR, things will work _automagically_. ExpressJS is about thinking about what your app needs and organizing it in a sensible way for what you have built. There is no one true way to organize an ExpressJS app, and you have to configure each step. The configuration gives you more control over how to build your app.

## RESTful Routes

We will learn about RESTful routes - a pattern for naming our `routes` that will help us create an easy-to-use API.

We'll also need to use `middleware`, a functionality we want to apply to either multiple or all our routes.

Finally, we'll work on showing a view of a single bookmark and creating a new one.
