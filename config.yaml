      # Students should submit their backend as a lab
      # This is a monorepo, so the next thing they will do is the front-end
      # They should submit the front-end as a separate lab, even though it is in the same repo
      # Finally, they should submit their attempt at one to many as a third lab
      # The challenge is that the pursuit path changes for lesson to lesson
      # But the pursuit path should stay the same for the lab(s)
      # Right now, when there is a two day lab but one submission I just mark the activity as null
      # But in this case there are repeated submissions on the same repo
