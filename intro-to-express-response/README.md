## What is Node?

Node is an open-source project that lets us run JavaScript in Terminal. Previous to nodeJS, JavaScript could only be run in the browser.

By creating Node, companies could hire developers who specialize in JavaScript, and they would be able to build front-end Applications and back-end applications.

## What is NPM?

Coders often run into the same challenges over and over again. Rather than build out all the functionality from scratch for every single project, developers get together and build 3rd party (usually open-source) code libraries and frameworks.

It's a lot like the difference between making pasta and sauce from scratch (no code libraries or frameworks), which you can compare to buying pasta from a box (using a code library - it doesn't care what kind of dish you are makingâ€”or buying a frozen dinner (very opinionated about what you will be eating for dinner).

Libraries are just helper code, with little to no opinions on how you should use them. Frameworks tend to be much more opinionated on how to use them.

If you've ever worked with Bootstrap for CSS (or another CSS framework like Materialize, Skeleton, Bulma, etc.), you've used a 3rd party code framework. These libraries tried to solve common styling, UX/UI, and responsive design issues. You don't have to look at the code or know how it works. You just need to read the documentation to learn how to use the framework or library.

Node has an extensive library of 3rd party code called` Node Package Manager` (`npm` all lowercase).

We'll be writing our applications using some packages from npm.

## Making Your Own Project With Node

If you've ever downloaded some code onto your computer and to get the project started, you needed to run `npm install`, you've worked with a node project!

Now let's make our own. We'll make a server with express! Express is a popular npm framework that allows developers to build complex back ends that power some [prevalent websites](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/companies-using-express.html)

## Getting Started with Express

[Here is the documentation](https://expressjs.com). This documentation may be difficult to use if you are new to servers. You can utilize this documentation better as you gain more knowledge and experience.
